# University Campus System Network Design

## Project Overview

This project simulates a medium-sized hierarchical network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The topology includes multiple departments and VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, dynamic IP assignment, and secure remote access configurations. The aim is to build a scalable and secure network infrastructure suitable for an enterprise environment.

## üìã Project Objectives

- Create a hierarchical network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- Connect networking devices with appropriate cabling.
- Implement VLANs for logical segmentation.
- Perform subnetting and IP addressing.
- Configure Inter-VLAN Routing (Router-on-a-Stick).
- Set up DHCP pools on the router for dynamic IP allocation.
- Enable SSH for secure remote access to network devices.
- Use RIPv2 as the dynamic routing protocol.
- Apply Switchport Security on access ports.
- Configure host devices.
- Test and verify full network communication.

> All DHCP pools are configured on the router. Each VLAN is assigned to its corresponding subnet and gateway.

## Routing Protocol

- **RIPv2** is used for dynamic routing between VLAN interfaces.

---

## Security Features

- **SSH** configured for secure remote access on the router.
- **Switchport Security** applied on access ports to prevent unauthorized device access.

---

## Notes

- Host devices are assigned IPs dynamically using the router's DHCP pools.
- VLAN interfaces (SVIs) are created for each department.
- All devices are verified for successful communication using `ping`, `traceroute`, and `SSH`.
